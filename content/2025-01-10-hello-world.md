Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the web, where I share experiments with code, and the
occasional reflection on the intersection of logic and software engineering.

I'm Iago Bozza â€” a philosopher-turned-software engineer. I specialize in
building sites with Hugo, Next.js, and Supabase, and Iâ€™m currently diving deep
into Rust as I progress through the OSSU curriculum.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

This blog is a space where I write about computer science and software
development. Whether itâ€™s design principles, programming languages, or tools I
love (like Rust), you'll find posts that aim to inform and inspire.

## A Little About Me

Before venturing into the tech industry, I taught philosophy at the University
of Miami, where I dealt with topics like logic, metaphysics, and epistemology.
These experiences shaped my approach to problem-solving and structured
thinkingâ€”skills I now apply to software engineering.

Feel free to connect with me via GitHub or check out my "About" page for more
details about my work and background.

Thanks for stopping by, and cheers to learning together! ðŸŽ‰
