Hi, I'm **Iago Bozza**, a philosoher-turned-software-engineer!

I work as a freelance web developer (mostly frontend, but some backend too)
through Fiverr, but right now I'm looking to move more towards back-end related
work, and to find a more permanent job in a company where I can work with and
learn from other developers.


# Projects

I have a few portfolio projects listed below if you are interested in seeing
some things that I built. I've also done dozens of Hugo websites, including this
one! You can check out my [Fiverr
profile](https://www.fiverr.com/writeonlycode) if you are interested in taking
a look at the real projects I've done, and testimonials from clients!

periodically, and access to its entries' contents is provided through a modern
RESTful API.

Metronomify is a metronome plus practice manager with pomodoro functionalities.
It includes a built-in timer, a dashboard that list your practice sessions, and
a report pane that shows your sessions with beautiful graphs. It's powered by
Ruby on Rails in the back-end and React in the front-end. It uses React Query
for the state management and React components form Mantine.
